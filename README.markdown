__A turn-based "Monopoly Deal-like" card game__

Synopsis
--------

It is the end of the Second World War and the American empire is slowly rising
as a superpower (along with its arch-rival, the Soviet Union, but that is
unrelated). With this, many families around the world wanted in on the
prosperity of this great empire, and to pursue the "American Dream".

Features Planned
----------------

* Turn-based gameplay
* Multiplayer
* Single Player mode with AI
* Story mode: Complete the campaigns of three different families
* and much much more

Other features are still in writing, which I will probably add here later.
